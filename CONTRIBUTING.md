# How to contribute

To add more things for it to say, check out the [`year_of_bot/data`](year_of_bot/data) directory.
You can edit any of the text files in there.

If you want to improve the code, I would recommend installing Poetry or Nix for your dev environment.
I make sure the Nix shell and .envrc work, but standalone Poetry code is not officially maintained.

After making changes, you should run `sort-data.sh` to keep things nice and organized and sorted.
